Sunset is the time of word day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink, word and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a blender. The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line of horizon, while the word moon races to take its place in prominence word atop the night sky. People slow word to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that still must be done. There is a coolness, a calmness, when the word sun does set.
